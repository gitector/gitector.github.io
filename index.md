## Check your commits not only code

Git history can be your source of truth. Same as with your code you need to take care of it.
Codebase linting is common practice but why neglect git history? How often you try to debug
Error and git blame is not helpful because of poor git message.

You can run gitector as part of your pre-commit check or CI pipeline.

## Gitector allows you to define rules for your commit

You can configure gitector in any way some of possible features include:

- Allow only commits with Ticket number
- Allow commiters with only certain email 
- Disallow merges 
- Define maximum characters for title
- Encourage small commits by limiting amount of files in single commit
- Make sure commit starts with action verb describing changes (like add, remove, fix)
